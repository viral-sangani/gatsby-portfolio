# Bookmytool

Book My Tool is a startup, founded with an intention to support all SME, MSME & large scale industries to come on one portal to share/leverage their strengths by using e-platform & get the best efficiency.

I have created the whole backend for this startup including, Admin panel, RESP APIs, and deployment of all services in AWS.

Technologies used in this project:

-   Django
-   Django REST Framework
-   JWT Tokens
-   HTML, CSS, JS
-   Jquery, AJAX
-   Webpack - JavaScript module bundle
-   AWS S3 - To store all static files
-   AWS EC2 - To host development and production server
-   AWS Route53 - For Domain config
-   AWS SES - For sending Email notifications to users
-   AWS RDS - For Postgresql database
-   AWS Cloudfront - As CDN for S3 bucket data

This startup project also has an Android app created using Flutter which is consuming the REST APIs.

Me and my team, have created this project from scratch to market-ready, and it was a great experience on how to make professional website and apps.

We learned how to work as a team, and deliver modules on time to clients. Although we faced some issued, we solved all that problem and made it to production. Bookmytool has launched their first version and new updates are on its way.

In the end, it was a very nice experience to work with professionals and deliver the project in the 3rd year of our engineering college.
